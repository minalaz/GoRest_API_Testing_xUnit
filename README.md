# GoRest

Project with the task of creating API tests on different endpoints.
It covers CRUD requests with predefined and randomized valid inputs, as well as a Post request with invalid inputs such as nullable values.
In these tests, assertions for Status Code are visible, as well as comparative values in the request body and response body when executing the given requests.
